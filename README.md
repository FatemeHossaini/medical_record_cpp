# Simple Medical Record System

This is a terminal-based C++ application designed to help users manage basic medical records for patients.    
It allows you to store essential information like patient ID, name, and age, and provides a clean, menu-driven interface to interact with the data.    
The project is ideal for C++ beginners who want to practice working with struct, vectors, functions, and user input/output in a real-world mini project.     
Although simple in structure, it serves as a great foundation for building more advanced systems in the future.     

# What this project does

Add new patients (ID, name, age)
View all saved patients
Run the program using a simple text-based menu

# How to use it

Open the main.cpp file in your C++ IDE (e.g., Code::Blocks, Dev-C++, Visual Studio, etc.)  
Compile and run the code.  
Use the on-screen menu to add or view patient records.

# Future Ideas

Add search and delete features   
Save and load patient data from a file   
Include more fields (e.g., diagnosis, contact info, visit history)
